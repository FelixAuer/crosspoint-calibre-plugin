# Calibre Plugins

Calibre plugins for [CrossPoint Reader](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader).

## Plugins

### CrossPoint Reader

A wireless device plugin that uploads EPUB files to CrossPoint Reader over WebSocket. The plugin auto-discovers devices on the local network via UDP broadcast.

See [crosspoint_reader/README.md](crosspoint_reader/README.md) for protocol details and configuration.

## Installation

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/calibre-plugins/releases), then in Calibre: **Preferences > Plugins > Load plugin from file**.

## Development

### Setup

```sh
# Build and install the plugin into Calibre
make install

# List all installed plugins
make list

# Remove the plugin
make remove
```

See [`calibre-customize` docs](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/calibre-customize.html) for more options.

### Releasing

The version is read from the `version` tuple in `crosspoint_reader/driver.py`.

```sh
# Bump the version (updates driver.py in place)
make bump-patch   # 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
make bump-minor   # 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
make bump-major   # 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0

# Package the plugin into a zip (crosspoint_reader-vX.Y.Z.zip)
make zip

# Create a GitHub release with the zip attached (runs `make zip` first)
make release
```

`make release` uses the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) to create a tagged release with auto-generated notes.

Typical workflow:

1. `make bump-patch` (or `bump-minor` / `bump-major`)
2. Commit the version change
3. `make release`
